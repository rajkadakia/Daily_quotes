# 🔁 Auto-Updating Quotes Repository

This repository automatically updates its `README.md` file every 4 days with 1 new quote — either motivational or technology-related — using a GitHub Actions workflow.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Every 4 days, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.
- A quote category (`motivational` or `tech`) is randomly selected.
- 1 quote is fetched from online APIs:
  - **Motivational**: [ZenQuotes.io](https://zenquotes.io)
  - **Tech/General**: [Quotable API](https://api.quotable.io)
